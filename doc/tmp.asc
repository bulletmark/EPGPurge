= Topfield TMS PVR jumpit TAP program
:toc: true

== Introduction
This is a Topfield TMS PVR TAP program that applies a simple **binary
search** to manually search and jump to new position in a recorded or
time-slipped program. Jumpit can also be configured to action ordinary
one-off "fixed jumps" only, if you prefer a very simple user interface.
Refer to the configuration options below.

== Basic Operation

Press the RIGHT, LEFT, UP, or DOWN buttons to start. Pressing RIGHT or
UP jumps forwards, LEFT or DOWN jumps backwards. A small position window
will pop up and display your current jump position, last jump size, and
next jump size. If you are past or ahead of your desired new position,
then press LEFT or RIGHT again. The program will halve each step so that
it "narrows down" to your desired position. If you make a mistake or get
lost you can press RECALL (or GUIDE if more convenient on your remote)
to return to your previous position. The RECALL key is used to _Undo_. Each
press of the RECALL key will unstack the previous position, all the way
back to the starting position if press the RECALL key repeatedly.
Pressing UP or DOWN will jump full (coarse) steps until you get to a new
position to start a new half (fine) search. Press OK to close the jump
window at any position. You can also press OK initially to bring up the
position window before you start jumping.

== Configuration and Advanced Operation

The default (and initial) jump size is 3 mins. Rather than the
navigation keys described above, you can also load and jump using
different initial jump sizes by pressing one of the 4 colour/function
buttons as described below in <<r_keys,Key Assignments>>. The 4 colour/func
buttons are fixed "hot" jump keys but, in the default configuration, are
only active if the jumpit window is displayed so you can still use the
regular TMS colour/func key skip assignments.

You can change any of the default jump sizes and configure options by
pressing the MENU key while the jumpit window is displayed. A
configuration screen will display. Press UP/DOWN to select a jump value
or option; and then press the RIGHT/LEFT keys to increment/decrement
that jump value or option. The new value is saved permanently. Press
MENU or OK or EXIT to close the configuration window and return to the
normal jumpit window.

The following configuration options are available:

- **Remote/model type**: Default value = *71XX*.

  * *71XX*: Set to this type for models 7100+, 7160, 7170, etc.

  * *24XX*: Set to this type for models 2400, 2460, 2470, etc.

- **Skipping mode**: Default value = *Binary*.

  * *Binary*: Use binary search algorithm with window navigation and
    position history.

  * *Fixed*: Use simple fixed step jumps without window navigation or
    position history, etc.

- **Left/Right keys jump**: Default value = 3:00 mins. The default
  starting jump size in +ve seconds for the LEFT and RIGHT keys.

- **Up key jump**: Default value = 3:00 mins. The starting jump size
  when the Up key is pressed. It can be -ve or +ve although you would
  normally set this +ve. If set to 0 then the Up key is always ignored
  by jumpit.

- **Down key jump**: Default value = -3:00 mins. The starting jump size
  when the Down key is pressed. It can be -ve or +ve although you would
  normally set this -ve. If set to 0 then the Down key is always ignored
  by jumpit.

- **Red/F1 key jump**: Default value = -1:00 min. The starting jump size
  when the Red/F1 key is pressed. It can be -ve or +ve. If set to 0 then
  the Red/F1 key is always ignored by jumpit.

- **Green/F2 key jump**: Default value = -0:20 secs. The starting jump
  size when the Green/F2 key is pressed. It can be -ve or +ve. If set to
  0 then the Green/F2 key is always ignored by jumpit.

- **Yellow/F3 key jump**: Default value = +0:20 secs. The starting jump
  size when the Yellow/F3 key is pressed. It can be -ve or +ve. If set
  to 0 then the Yellow/F3 key is always ignored by jumpit.

- **Blue/F4 key jump**: Default value = +1:00 min. The starting jump
  size when the Blue/F4 key is pressed. It can be -ve or +ve. If set to
  0 then the Blue/F4 key is always ignored by jumpit.

- **Window timeout**: Default value = 0:30 secs. The number of seconds
  after the last key-press after which the jumpit window is
  automatically closed. **NOTE**: This value is not appropriate to
  *Fixed* mode skipping and so is disabled in that mode.

- **Close window at last secs**: Default value = 0:00 secs (i.e.
  disabled). The number of seconds at which your **last** step causes
  the window to be automatically closed. Set to zero to disable this
  function. Enabling this means jumpit will automatically close the
  window for you when you have narrowed your binary search down to a
  small time area. **NOTE**: This value is not appropriate to *Fixed*
  mode skipping and so is disabled in that mode.

- **Left/Right keys**: Default value = *On Always*.

   * *Ignore*: Always ignore the LEFT and RIGHT keys (and thus
     leave them for standard or other TAP use etc).

   * *On Window*: Only action the LEFT and RIGHT keys when the
     jumpit window is already displayed, else ignore them (and thus
     leave them for standard or other TAP use etc).

   * *On Always*: Action the LEFT and RIGHT keys whenever they
     are pressed and automatically display the jumpit window if not
     already displayed.

**NOTE**: If you have configured global *Fixed* mode skipping then
above *On Window* is effectively the same as *Ignore*.

- **Up/Down keys**: Default value = *On Always*.

   * *Ignore*: Always ignore the UP and DOWN keys (and thus
     leave them for standard or other TAP use etc).

   * *On Window*: Only action the UP and DOWN keys when the
     jumpit window is already displayed, else ignore them (and thus
     leave them for standard or other TAP use etc).

   * *On Always*: Action the UP and DOWN keys whenever they
     are pressed and automatically display the jumpit window if not
     already displayed.

   * *Fixed*: Use the Up/Down keys as simple fixed step jumps without
     initiating window navigation or position history, etc. The other
     keys can be configured to use binary skipping mode in conjunction
     with fixed mode Up/Down keys.

You can also disable an Up or Down key individually by setting its
jump value to zero as described above.
**NOTE**: If you have configured global *Fixed* mode skipping then
above *On Window* is effectively the same as *Ignore*.

- **Colour/Func keys**: Default value = *On Window*.

   * *Ignore*: Always ignore the Colour/Func keys (and thus
     leave them for standard or other TAP use etc).

   * *On Window*: Only action the Colour/Func keys when the
     jumpit window is already displayed, else ignore them (and thus
     leave them for standard or other TAP use etc).

   * *On Always*: Action the Colour/Func keys whenever they
     are pressed and automatically display the jumpit window if not
     already displayed.

   * *Fixed*: Use the colour/func keys as simple fixed step jumps without
     initiating window navigation or position history, etc. The other
     keys can be configured to use binary skipping mode in conjunction
     with fixed mode colour/func keys.

You can also disable a colour/func key individually by setting its
jump value to zero as described above.
**NOTE**: If you have configured global *Fixed* mode skipping then
above *On Window* is effectively the same as *Ignore*.

== Other Notes

Skipping using a binary/half search technique initially seems cumbersome
to most users compared to regular fixed time skips. After a little
practice however, you should find that you can skip much faster and also
much more accurately to a specific place. This TAP happily coexists with
the regular TMS skip buttons so, for example, you could use this TAP but
others in your household can continue to use the regular TMS skip
buttons or another TAP. You may need to configure the LEFT/RIGHT/UP/DOWN
and/or Colour keys *On Window/Always/Ignore* as appropriate to accommodate
this. See above description of these options.

The jumpit window times out and dismisses itself after 30 secs (default)
of no key presses. This timeout is user configurable via the MENU
configuration screen.

Jumpit is only active in playback or timeslip modes, not in normal
(realtime) tv mode. However, if you are watching normal tv and want to
search backwards using jumpit, just press the standard blue button once
(i.e. 10 secs backwards) which will put you in timeslip mode, and from
there you can navigate using jumpit.

This TAP is compatible with TMS Commander.

I developed this on my Australian TF7100HDPlus model PVR but it should
work on at least the other Australian TMS models, e.g. TRF-2400,
TRF-2460, TRF-2470, TRF7170, and TRF7160. Make sure you set the
appropriate remote/model type in Menu/Settings. Note that jumpit will only
work in timeslip mode on firmwares with "quad-recording" capability
(atm).

A special thanks to Toni Salomaki for the *skipit* TAP which I used for
years on my TF5000 and from where I got the inspiration for this TAP.

== Key Assignments

Keys are only assigned by **jumpit** when you are viewing a recorded or
time-slipped program. Most keys are only assigned when the jumpit window
is displayed.

.Key Assignments
[options="header",cols="1,6"]
|==============================================================================
|Key         |Description
|OK          |Open or close jumpit display.
|UP          |Perform full jump (normally configured forwards), default = +3:00 mins.
|DOWN        |Perform full jump (normally configured backwards), default = -3:00 mins.
|RIGHT       |Perform binary forward half jump.
|LEFT        |Perform binary backward half jump.
|RECALL/GUIDE/LIST|Reverse last jump (LIST key on 7100+/7170/7160).
|MENU        |Open configuration display (then use UP/DOWN to navigate and then RIGHT/LEFT to change value).
|RED/F1      |Perform configured jump fwd or back, default = -1:00 min.
|GREEN/F2    |Perform configured jump fwd or back, default = -0:20 secs.
|YELLOW/F3   |Perform configured jump fwd or back, default = +0:20 secs.
|BLUE/F3     |Perform configured jump fwd or back, default = +1:00 min.
|SLEEP       |Shutdown and stop jumpit TAP.
|EXIT        |Close jumpit display.
|==============================================================================

In typical binary ad-skipping use, you will only press the RIGHT and
LEFT buttons to skip; and then OK to close. Sometimes you will use the
UP and DOWN buttons to coarse skip through a program.

== Installation

Unzip the jumpit zip file and then use an FTP client to copy
*jumpit.tap* to `ProgramFiles/AutoStart/` directory (or copy it via a
USB flash stick). Start it explicitly or restart your PVR. There are no
other files required. The TAP will automatically create and maintain an
INI file if you change any of the default configuration values.

== Procedure to reset all configuration settings to defaults

Press the Sleep button while the jumpit window is displayed to shutdown
the jumpit TAP. Then point your web browser at your Topfield PVR and log
in with your user/pass. Select *File Management/TAP
Files/Settings/jumpit.ini* to delete that file. Then restart the TAP on
your Topfield (or just restart your PVR if you don't know how to do
this). Jumpit will create an empty INI file on startup but will only
ever save configuration options which you change from the default.

== Change History

v1:: Initial public release.

v1.1:: You can now press the RIGHT or LEFT buttons and immediately
action jumpit without pressing OK first.

v1.2:: The screen timeout (default 30 secs) is now configurable. Also
added a configuration option to require first OK button or not
(default is off) so that other skipping TAPs may intercept the LEFT
and RIGHT keys before OK.

v1.3:: Added another configuration option to require first OK button
for colour/function buttons. Default *1st Left/Right needs OK* setting
is off, default *1st Colour/Func needs OK* setting is on. Most people
would want instant left/right skipping, but preserve ordinary TMS
instant skipping and bookmark functions using the colour/func keys
until OK is pressed.

v1.4:: Also enabled UP and DOWN with LEFT and RIGHT if configured for
immediate initial use. Changed name of those configuration options and
updated README description throughout to favour immediate skipping
operation.

v1.5:: Cleaned up and improved options yet again.
* Added option to auto-close window if last jump secs is within a
  configured value.
* Added ability to ignored selected or all colour/func keys.
* Added ability to enable/disable RIGHT/LEFT and UP/DOWN keys independently.
* Added ability to configure jumpit as a standard skipper with no window.
* Updated README file throughout and added full description of each
  configuration item.

v1.6:: Added configuration option for easy setup between Binary or Fixed
mode skipping.

v1.7:: Added separate jump size configuration for UP and DOWN keys. Jump
values can now be configured in steps of 5 secs rather than 10 secs.

v1.8:: Added option to configure colour/func keys, and/or Up/Down keys,
as fixed skip mode only, but with the ability to use them in
conjunction with binary skip Left/Right keys. Basically, this gives
the ability to use some keys for fixed skipping, while maintaining
primary binary skipping mode.

v1.9:: Added option to configure Up and Down keys with different jump sizes.

v1.10:: Changed key *Off* configuration name to *Ignore* to better indicate
the meaning. I.e. if a key set to *Ignore*, or it's jump value is
set to 0, then jumpit does not intercept that key at all and lets it
through to be acted on by another tap, or the standard system.

v1.11:: Jumpit fixed to not intercept any keys when % window is displayed.

v1.12 2012-Oct-06:: Added option to set remote/model type = 71XX or 24XX
to handle key differences.

v1.13 2013-02-18:: Added TAP_ID function to appear in TMSCommander tap list.
